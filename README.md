# node-chat-app
This repo contains the code for NodeJS course introduced by Andrew Mead on Udemy.

- I built chat-app using NodeJS, express framework and socket.io library.

- Users are able to join a chat room by providing a username and the name of the chat room they wish to join, creating an account is not required.

- Users can share their location to everyone in the room they also can view list of users who are currently enrolled in the chat room.
